/**
 * @file logger.h
 * @author Barak Sason Rofman
 * @brief This module provides an implementation of a logger utility which works on 3 levels:
 * Level 1 - Lockless writing:
 * 			Lockless writing is achieved by assigning each thread a private ring buffer.
 * 			A worker threads write to that buffer and the logger thread drains that buffer into
 * 			a log file.
 * Level 2 - Shared buffer writing:
 * 			In case the private ring buffer is full and not yet drained, a worker thread will
 * 			fall down to writing to a shared buffer (which is shared across all workers).
 * 			This is done in a synchronized manner.
 * Level 3 - In case the shared buffer is also full and not yet
 * 			drained, a worker thread will fall to the lowest (and slowest) form of writing - direct
 * 			file write.
