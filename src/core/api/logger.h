/**
 * @file logger.h
 * @author Barak Sason Rofman
 * @brief This module provides an implementation of a logger utility.
 *
 * The idea behind this utility is to reduce as much as possible the impact of logging on runtime.
 * Part of this reduction comes at the cost of having to parse and reorganize the messages in the log files
 * using a dedicated tool (yet to be implemented) as there is no guarantee on the order of logged messages.
 *
 * The logger operates in the following way:
 * The logger provides several (number and size are user-defined) pre-allocated buffers which threads
 * can 'register' to and receive a private buffer.
 * In addition, a single, shared buffer is also pre-allocated (size is user-defined).
 * The number of buffers and their size is modifiable at runtime (not yet implemented).
 *
 * The basic logic of the logger utility is that worker threads write messages in one of 3 ways that
 * will be described next, and an internal logger threads constantly iterates the existing buffers and
 * drains the data to the log file.
 *
 * As all allocation are allocated at the initialization stage, no special treatment it needed for "out
 * of memory" cases.
 *
 * The following writing levels exist:
 * Level 1 - Lockless writing:
 * 				Lockless writing is achieved by assigning each thread a private ring buffer.
 * 				A worker threads write to that buffer and the logger thread drains that buffer into
 * 				a log file.
 *
 * 	In case the private ring buffer is full and not yet drained, or in case the worker thread has not
 * 	registered for a private buffer, we fall down to the following writing methods:
 *
 * Level 2 - Shared buffer writing:
 * 				The worker thread will write it's data into a buffer that's shared across all threads.
 * 				This is done in a synchronized manner.
 *
 * 	In case the private ring buffer is full and not yet drained AND the shared ring buffer is full and not
 * 	yet drained, or in case the worker thread has not registered for a private buffer, we fall down to
 * 	the following writing methods:
 *
 * Level 3 - Direct write:
 * 				This is the slowest form of writing - the worker thread directly write to the log file.
